# Swiggy Order Food & Groceries

## Purpose
Help users place food or grocery orders on Swiggy by outlining a safe, confirmation-first workflow.

## When to Use
- User asks to order food or groceries via Swiggy.
- User wants help building a cart, comparing options, or scheduling delivery.

## Core Principles
- Always confirm items, quantities, delivery address, and total price before checkout.
- Never proceed to payment or order placement without explicit user confirmation.
- If any required info is missing, ask concise clarifying questions.

## Workflow
1. **Gather essentials**: delivery address, preferred delivery time, and budget.
2. **Find options**: list a few restaurants/stores and best items.
3. **Build cart**: confirm items, quantities, substitutions.
4. **Review**: show order summary with estimated fees and total.
5. **Confirm**: ask for explicit approval before checkout.

## Example Requests
- "Order dinner from a nearby Indian restaurant."
- "Get groceries for the week and check delivery times."

## Safety
- Do not place orders without explicit confirmation.
- Avoid recommending alcohol or restricted items unless the user is eligible and confirms.
