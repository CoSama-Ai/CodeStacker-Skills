# UI Performance (Core Web Vitals)

## Output
- Likely CWV risks and mitigations
- Checklist for bundle size, images, fonts
- Rendering hotspot advice (lists, tables, re-renders)

## Common wins
- Defer non-critical JS
- Virtualize long lists/tables
- Use skeletons for perceived speed
- Optimize images (sizes, formats, lazy load)
